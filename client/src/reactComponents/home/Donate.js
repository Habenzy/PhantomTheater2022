          <p>As a loyal supporter of Phantom, you are the heart of our audience, the reason we do what we do.</p>
          <p>Historically, Phantom Theater has relied on local businesses and ticket sales to help performers cover travel and lodging, as well as a small honorarium for their creative work.  Unfortunately, that honorarium often fell short in reimbursing the tremendous effort that goes into our artistsâ€™ innovative entertainment. Last year we started the Friend of the Artists initiative to help us offer more substantial support to our creative community who performs here at Phantom Theater. When asked to donate what they could, our Friends came through, with an average donation of $150.
