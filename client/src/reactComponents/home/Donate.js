          <p>Phantom Theater is for and by artists and the community.  We are committed to supporting both through the performing arts.  While a portion of admissions to our shows helps offset our operating costs - including rent, utilities, and an honorarium for our artistic director - we rely on donations and grants for both seasonal costs and major upgrades.  For instance, in 2021 we replaced our archaic and faulty lighting system with a modern LED grid and board through the generosity of our patrons, a benefit performance by <a href="https://wesliband.com/">Wesli</a>, and the <a href="https://www.vermonthumanities.org/">Vermont Humanities Council</a>.

          Every donation counts!  And as a 501.c3 organization, every donation is also tax deductible.  Please consider adding your name to the list of donors today! Checks can be made out to Phantom Theater and sent to Mary Moffroid at PO Box 373 in Warren, VT 05674.
