            An Invitation to become a Friend of the Artists of Phantom Theater
          </b>
          <br></br>
          <p>
            Historically, Phantom Theater has relied on local businesses and
            ticket sales to help performers cover travel and lodging, as well as
            a small honorarium for their creative work. Unfortunately, that
            honorarium often fell short in reimbursing the tremendous effort
            that goes into our artists’ innovative entertainment. Last year we
            started the <i>Friend of the Artists</i> initiative to help us offer
            more substantial support to our creative community who performs here
            at Phantom Theater.
          </p>
          <p>
            Will you join us this year as a <i>Friend of the Artists</i> and
            contribute what you can to this worthy cause? Your support will be
            acknowledged on our website and in our materials, and - more
            importantly - you will make a real difference to the people who
            enrich us all with their art.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thank you so very much for considering a contribution to Phantom
            Theater. .
