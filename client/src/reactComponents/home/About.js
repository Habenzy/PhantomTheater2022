          Phantom Theater was created in Warren, Vermont in 1985. Since its
          inception, Phantom has brought professional theater artists from
          Vermont as well as many cities throughout the country to act, direct,
          dance, teach workshops, and compose and play music. Phantomâ€™s mission
          is to explore and experiment with theatrical, musical, and
          dance/movement ideas by supporting the authentic vision of each artist
          or student. The theater presents original works of art, serving as
          both a venue for polished performances and a laboratory for the
          development of new pieces.

            <h4 className="barn">THE EDGCOMB BARN</h4>
            Direct from a Sears
            Roebuck catalog kit, the historic Edgcomb Barn is Phantom Theater's
            home. A space at once intimate and gracious, it brings the flavor of Vermont to all of our productions. (The occasional cat or bat has been known to steal a scene.) The surrounding grounds make an excellent place for a pre-show picnic.
